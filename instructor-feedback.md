## Instructor Feedback

This document highlights the feedback and suggestions provided by the instructor for assignments where I did not score full marks. 


**OPPE:** 

*Score* - 38/50

*Feedback* - Good Effort!! In your code, you have used local host. all the 3 resources are supposed to run in different environments..

---

**Assignment 5:** 

*Score* - 8.33/10

*Feedback* - Output demonstrated in the video is not the expected one. The code uses PySpark DataFrame APIs, not SQL..

---

**Assignment 7:** 

*Score* - 9.33/10 

*Feedback* - Good Work!! Not explained the code in the video. Expected output is not generated. Kafka, producer and consumer should be in separate resources. Kafka can be in a VM or cluster,Producer can be in a VM or GCF and Consumer should run on a cluster. Please practice it for OPPE.

**Assignment 8:** 

*Score* - 10/10

*Feedback* - Good Work!! Please use cluster for spark jobs. Using a VM is just opposite of distributed computing.
